serial_mpu9150
==============

Using serial library and FreeIMU library with the sensors MPU9150 and Adafruit MPL115A2, integrated with ROS. Got the processing code found inside the FreeIMU library and translate Java coding to C++ so it could be used with the serial library.
Thanks to Gary Servin who made the example of using the serial library with ROS.
